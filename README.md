# Calculator
A simple calculator application built in Java to practice unit testing using the Arrange–Act–Assert (AAA) pattern.

This project serves as practice and preparation for my main project, helping me strengthen my testing and code quality skills. It focuses on writing clean, testable, and maintainable code while applying best practices in Test-Driven Development (TDD) with JUnit.


Features:
Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)

Modular, testable code design

Unit tests following the AAA pattern

Practice project to complement my main work
